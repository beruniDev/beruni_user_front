        The Al-Beruni Institute of Oriental Studies of Uzbekistan of Academy of
        Sciences has a collection of oriental manuscripts which can well match
        with any treasury of its kind of the world both in its scientific value
        and wealth. Primarily, with the aim of comprehensive study of rich
        collections of manuscripts the Institute on the Study of Oriental
        Manuscripts under the Uzbekistan Academy of Sciences was established in
        1943. All manuscript copies kept in the Eastern Department of the State
        Public Library of the Uzbek SSR were turned over to the newly organized
        Institute. At first, the Institute had only one section – on the Study
        of oriental Manuscripts. However, with the expansion of the Institute’s
        researches also grew the number of these sections, including sessions on
        primary processing and classification, scientific description and
        cataloguing, research and publication of manuscript and publication of
        manuscript and documents, as well as the section on studying of
        political, economic and cultural life of neighboring foreign states and
        their relations with Central Asia. The Institute itself changed its
        name. Now it is known as the Abu Raikhan Beruni Institute of Oriental
        Studies of Academy of Sciences of the Republic of Uzbekistan. At present
        the depository of the Institute of Oriental Studies contains over 25 000
        volumes of manuscripts. Many of these are collections with several works
        bound into one volume. These works were written in Uzbek, Arabic,
        Persian, Tajik, Urdu, Pushtu, Azerbaijanian, Turkish, Tatar, Turkmenian,
        Uighur and other languages of the Eastern peoples. They cover a wide
        range of subjects: history, history of literature, philosophy, law,
        astronomy, physics, chemistry, medicine, languages, pharmacology,
        geography, music, mathematics, mineralogy, rural economy, fine arts,
        etc. These are all of great significance for the study of history and
        culture of the peoples of Central Asia, India, Pakistan, Afghanistan,
        the Arab countries, Iran and other Eastern countries, with the aim of
        tracking back political, economic, diplomatic and cultural relations
        among them. The most ancient works deposited at the Institute boast of
        their history more than one thousand years. Among them is the work by
        the prominent scholar of the East Ibn Sallam (died in 222 of the
        Hijra/837 A.D.) “Garib al-hadith” (Rare Dicta in Hadith). The latest
        works are dated by the early twentieth century. We can get information
        from the compiled catalogues about the themes, quantity and even the
        condition of the manuscripts in the Libraries of the World. In other
        words the catalogue serve us a guide for searching for manuscripts. 11
        volumes of the Catalogue of eastern Manuscripts “Cобрание восточных
        рукописей” (СВР) have already been compiled and printed. But these
        volumes include the descriptions of 7500 copies only. It should be
        noted, that in the second half of 90es the Institute changed the
        principals in cataloguing and began the compiling of thematic
        catalogues. As result, the Catalogue of historical Compositions (CBP
