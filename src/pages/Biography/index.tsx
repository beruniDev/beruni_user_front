          town of Kyat, the ancient capital of Khorezm. He was brought up in the
          family of a famous scholar, prominent mathematician and astronomer Abu
          Nasr ibn Irak, which belonged to the dynasty of Khorezm-shah –
          Afrigides. Living at court Beruni could get good education which
          enabled him to start making research.

        <p className="indent-6">
          Abu Rayhan Beruni was born on September 4, 973 in the suburbs of the
          town of Kyat, the ancient capital of Khorezm. He was brought up in the
          family of a famous scholar, prominent mathematician and astronomer Abu

          enabled him to start making research.
        </p>
        <p className="indent-6">
          In about the year of 1004 Beruni had moved to the city of Gurganj (the
          new capital of Khorezm-shahs), where at court of the governor
          Abu-l-Abbas Ma’mun ibn Ma’mun (1009-1017) he occupied an honoured
          position and went on his scientific work at the Ma’mun Academy in
          Khorezm. In 1017 on the strong request from the sultan Mahmud Gaznavi,
          he and scholars moved to the city of Gazna, where Beruni stayed till
          the end of his life. He died in Gazna on December 11, 1048.

        </p>
        <h3 className="indent-6 mt-3">Contribution to the World Science</h3>

        <p className="indent-6">
          Whereas, he was first to introduce a circumference with a single
          radius to scientific circulation in trigonometry, he took
          trigonometric lines for functions and introduced the notion of
          ‘functions’.
        </p>

        <p className="indent-6">
          In mathematics, he could generalize the famous Indian mathematical
          problem on calculating of the sum of geometric sequence of 64-degree
          with the base of 2 to any degree, invented new ways of projecting,
          triangulation, (measuring distances using the method of solving using
          triangles), method of square interpolation, and the use of complex
          trigonometric formulas enabled him to enhance the astronomic
          researches.
        </p>

        <p className="indent-6">
          In astronomy, he used to assert a similar fiery nature of the sun and
          stars, which is different to the dark celestial bodies – planets,
          mobility of stars and their huge size compared to the size of the
          Earth, as well as he suggested the idea of gravitation. He maintained
          the slope angle of ecliptics (a yearly path of the sun) to the
          equator, calculated the radius of the Earth, and described the colours
          of the Moon during moon eclipses, and the Sun crown when the sun
          eclipse happens.
        </p>

        <p className="indent-6">
          In his manuscript “India” he opened this mysterious for the western
          world country in terms of its language, ethnic and cultural and
          historical aspects.
        </p>

        <p className="indent-6">
          In mineralogy Beruni was first to measure the specific gravities of
          solid bodies and liquids using his own instrument, based on which he
          suggested classification of minerals; developed his theory on
          minerals’ origin and gave paragenetic data.
        </p>

        <p className="indent-6">
          In geology, he promoted a series of scientific ideas, including the
          geotechtonical, i.e. the idea of mobility, as well as the geological
          evolution of the Amudarya and the Arabian Desert.
        </p>

        <p className="indent-6">
          In physics, Beruni held weather-forecast, hydrostatic and optical
          observations and explained the vacuum.
        </p>

        <p className="indent-6">
          In chemistry, he exposed the theory of transmutation of elementary
          metals into precious ones, to strong criticism.
        </p>

        <p className="indent-6">
          In geography, he suggested an extraordinary theory of seas and the
          idea of building of the first in the world spherical globe of the
          Earth, as well as he made a hypothetical assumption of the
          availability of a continent behind the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.
        </p>

        <p className="indent-6">
          In pharmacology, he made a structured collection of all known in that
          period medicines (drugs) of the mineral, herbal, animal origin, which
          helped the development of the drug science in the medieval time.
        </p>
        <h3 className="indent-6 mt-3">World Recognition</h3>
        <p className="indent-6">
          Of all his manuscripts retained to-date, 31 works have been translated
          into German, English, Russian and Uzbek, 24 of the works have been
          researched and 3 of the manuscripts have been published in the
          original Arabic language. Beruni was recognized in the history of
          sciences as the founder of the new field – geodesy (the science of
          measuring the relief and surface of land using due instruments.
        </p>
        <p className="indent-6">
          His name was immortalized in the name of the lunar crater. One of the
          minor planets of the solar system, discovered in 1986 and registered
          in Harvard Center under the Ref.N0 9936, was named after him.
