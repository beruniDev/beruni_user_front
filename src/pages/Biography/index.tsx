          Abu al-Raihan al-Biruni: his life and works
        </h1>
        <p className="mt-2">
          Abu al-Raihan al-Biruni was born on 3rd of Dhul-Hijjah 362 AH / 4
          September 973 A.D. in Kyat city, the ancient capital city of Khorazm.
          Ancient Kyat was situated on the right bank of the Amu Darya River, on
          the site, which was renamed in Biruni (former Shabbaz) of the district
          center of the Khorazm province of Uzbekistan. The full name of the
          scholar is Abu al-Rayhan Muhammad ibn Ahmad al-Biruni. As for the part
          of “Birun” in this full name, it means “outside” (“external”). It
          reflects a tradition existed in medieval Khorezm. According to Yaqut
          al-Hamawi (1179–1229) the Khorezmians used a by-name “Biruni” for
          those compatriots who left the homeland for a long time or forever.
          Later this by-name became part of the full name of the scholar.
          However, the famous historian Abu al-Fadl al-Bayhaqi (d. 1077) who
          knew him personally, did not apply the by-name “Biruni” in relation to
          him, and called him only “Abu Rayhan”. This part of the name means
          “father of Rayhan”, “compassionate”, “merciful”.
        </p>
        <p className="indent-6">
          Childhood and youth of al-Biruni were in Kyat under the rule of Abu
          Abdullah Muhammad ibn Ahmad ibn Iraq, the last of the Khorazm rulers
          from the Afrigid dynasty.
        </p>

        <p className="indent-6">
          There is no extant information on early childhood of al-Biruni.
          According to the scientist himself, he knew either his father, or his
          grandfather. Apparently, he became an orphan as a child. Therefore,
          there is no information on how and by whom and where he was educated.
          In any case, his striving for knowledge and inquisitiveness seem to
          have been inborn traits of his character. This is evidenced by his
          next words, recorded by him in his “Pharmacognosy”: “By nature, since
          my youth I have been endowed with eagerness to acquiring knowledge, in
          respect to [my] age and circumstances. As evidence of this it is
          enough [the following]: one Greek man moved to our lands [then] and I
          brought [him] grains, seeds, fruits and plants and the rest, enquiring
          how they are called in his own language and wrote down their names”.
          Due to his keen wit and talent, he attracted the attention of the Kyat
          rulers of the Irakid house. The scientist himself said the following:
        </p>
        <p className="!text-center">
          “The family of the Iraqs nursed me with milk, Their Mansour took up my
          upbringing”.
        </p>
        <p className="indent-6">
          This quatrain reads of Abu Nasr Mansur ibn Ali ibn Iraq, the son of
          the uncle of Khorazmshah Abu Abdallah Muhammad ibn Ahmad ibn Iraq.
          According to these words of al-Biruni, his first teacher and mentor
          was Abu Nasr ibn Iraq. The date of birth of Abu Nasr is unknown.
          However, according to the bio-bibliographer Hayraddin al-Zirikli, he
          died in Ghazna in 1034. Abu Nasr ibn Iraq was a renowned mathematician
          and astronomer of his time. According to Umar Hayyam, “he was the
          greatest of the scholars involved in mathematics”. He provided the
          earliest proving for theorems of sines of plane and spherical
          triangles. He left about fifteen major works, the most famous of which
          is a comment on the “Sphaerica” by Menelaus, “Shah’s Almagest”
          (“Almazhist ash-Shahi”) dedicated to the Khoreazmshakh Ali ibn Ma’mun,
          a corrected improvement to the “Zij as-Safaih” (“Flattened Zij”) by
          Abu Ja’far al-Khazin, a commentary on the “Treatise on the proving of
          the operations with ephemeris” by Habash al-Hasib, “Treatise on the
          Astrolabe as-Saratani”, “A Treatise on the circles limiting the time
          hours” etc. Twelve of his works, Abu Nasr dedicated to his disciple
          al-Biruni.
        </p>

        <p className="indent-6">
          Having been raised and educated by that that individual, al-Biruni
          became an outstanding scholar of his time. He retained the boundless
          love and respect for his teacher throughout his life.
        </p>
        <p className="indent-6">
          It should be noted that the use of Zij of all kinds, including the
          “Zij” of Habash al-Hasib, requires having of profound knowledge of the
          theoretical and practical astronomy. Consequently, at the age of 16 or
          17 al-Biruni emerged as an established scholar, a leading scientist in
          the field of mathematics and astronomy. Of course, a great role in
          al-Biruni’s becoming a scholar at such an early age was played by Abu
          Nasr ibn Iraq. Having profoundly studied astronomy and mathematics
          under the guidance of his teacher in 384 AH /994 AD, al-Biruni with
          high accuracy determines the angle of inclination of the ecliptic to
          the celestial equator. He described this in detail in his “Geodezy” in
          the above-mentioned measuring he found this angle equal to 23035150II.
          One more description of al-Biruni’s measurements is provided in the
          same work; he measured the height of the sun during the summer and
          winter solstices in 994-995, and for that, he made a circular tool
          (gauge) with a diameter of 15 cubits (about 7.5 meters). The “Geodezy”
          contains the following words, indicating that a scientist conducted
          astronomical observations from a young age, “Because from my young age
          I was watching suchlike solar eclipses, my eyesight has deteriorated”.
        </p>
        <p className="indent-6">
          Undoubtedly, as a youth Biruni had extensive knowledge in the areas of
          science other than mathematics, astronomy, and not related to them.
          First of all, his knowledge of languages merits attention. Judging by
          the way of all his works written in Arabic, he had a perfect command
          of Arabic, which at that time was widespread in Islamic countries. His
          “Mineralogy”, “India” and other writings indicate that the scientist
          also knew Arabic poetry and the metric in it. His writings
          “Chronology”, “Canon of Mas’ud”, “Pharmacognosy” and others show that
          he knew Khorezmian, Sogdian, Farsi-Dari and other local languages.
          Al-Biruni writes in “Pharmacognosy” that he learned the Greek language
          from a Roman man, who lived in Khorazm” and perhaps he learned
          Sanskrit from the Indian merchants who permanently resided in the
          cities of Khorazm. The fact that a scientist in his young years
          studied the historical writings in the aforementioned languages was
          reflected in the “Chronology”.
        </p>
        <p className="indent-6">
          At the time, that is, up to 995, solving practical problems of
          astronomy, geography and geodesy, al-Biruni built a terrestrial globe
          for the first time in Central Asia. He mentions about that in his the
          treatise “Cartography”. At the beginning of his treatise, he recalls,
          “Our master, dear emir, fair-minded king, Khorezmshah”. H. Suter, who
          was the first to have studied the “Cartography” and partially
          translated it into German in 1922, for some reason did not pay
          attention to this information.
        </p>
        <p className="indent-6">
          In his “Cartography”, talking about “flat” (mubattah) astrolabe, he
          said, “God willing, I will write a special book on the construction of
          an astrolabe and the clarification of its truth”. To the astrolabe is
          devoted a chapter of his book “On the exhaustion of all possible
          methods to construct an astrolabe”. He mentions this treatise in
          “Chronology”. Therefore, it is written before 1000 A.D. From this, it
          follows that the “Cartography” was written before it, and this could
          only be up to 995, that is, it was compiled under the Khorezmshakh Abu
          Abdallah and dedicated to him. Thus, the “Cartography” was written
          before 995, and is the oldest of the extant works of the scientist.
        </p>
        <p className="indent-6">
          In the “Cartography” he mentions two earlier written treatises: the
          first is the “Book of constructing a globe”, it is mentioned only in
          the “Cartography”, and the second book is the “Makala on determination
          of longitude and latitude for localities on the Earth”, is referred to
          the works of al-Biruni.
        </p>
        <p className="indent-6">
          It follows from the above stated that at the age of about 20 years,
          i.e. a phenomenal early age, al-Biruni wrote at least three works,
          which can but amaze people.
        </p>

        <p className="indent-6">
          Thus, a young scientist at the age of 20-22, for the first time in the
          East built a globe of the Earth and a globe of the sky, and managed to
          write several works. However, a suddenly happened tragic event caught
          him by surprise and destroyed the fruit of several years of work. The
          scientist within the following few days was forced to leave his home
          country – Khorezm.
        </p>

        <p className="indent-6">
          In 995, the emir of Gurganj al-Ma’mun ibn Muhammad scented the
          ultimate weakness of the Samanid state because of internal turmoil,
          and suddenly attacked the capital of Kyat. The faithful to the
          Samanids Khorezmshah Abu Abdullah Muhammad was arrested and brought to
          Gurganj, then executed. Later he moved the capital to Gurganj and
          declared himself a Khorezmshah.
        </p>

        <p className="indent-6">
          In that year, al-Biruni reached the age of 21-22 years old, but he was
          already a renowned scholar. Due to his having close relations with the
          Iraqids family and his inquisitive mind, al-Biruni was among the
          confidants in the Khorezmshah palace court, as well as a prominent
          figure in the political life of the capital Kyat. Of course, in this
          situation it was dangerous for al-Biruni to remain in the capital.
          Therefore, first he had to hide in the capital, and then to emigrate.
        </p>

        <p className="indent-6">
          In the aforementioned 995, al-Biruni moved to the city of Ray south of
          the Caspian Sea. There, he collaborated with the famous tenth-century
          astronomer Abu Mahmud al-Khojandi. Then, in 997, he came to Kyat for a
          short time. The reason for his visit was his agreement by
          correspondence with Abu al-Wafa al-Buzjani who was in Baghdad that
          they would watch simultaneously the lunar eclipse of the year: Abu
          al-Wafa in Baghdad and in al-Biruni Kyat. Precisely in 997, the
          Khorezmshah Ma’mun ibn Muhammad was in Gurganj and died there, and his
          son Ali ibn al-Ma’mun took the throne. Apparently, al-Biruni was not
          in good relations with this Khorezmshah either, because after watching
          the above-mentioned lunar eclipse he briefly stayed in Kyat and at the
          invitation of the Emir Gurgan Qabus ibn Vashmgir (976-981, 998-1012)
          went to him.
        </p>

        <p className="indent-6">
          At first, Qabus showed favor to al-Biruni’s scientific work and
          rendered him a financial support. In response to these good traits of
          the ruler, al-Biruni devoted him one of his major works the “Monuments
          of the past nations” (“Chronology”). In general, the years spent by
          al-Biruni in Gurgan seemed to be fruitful: there he wrote a number of
          his works. Soon love of science and benevolence of Qabus ibn Vashmgir
          were replaced by ambition, as Yaqut al-Hamawi reported, Vashmgir
          required that al-Biruni was only with him and always stayed in the
          palace. But scholar rejected this claim and for that reason he again
          lost his rest. Having tempered mercy and goodness with anger, Qabus
          stopped benevolence and kindness and support to the scientist. As a
          result, al-Biruni was disabled from further scientific research,
          including his first attempt to measure the length of one degree of a
          meridian that failed. He wrote about that in his “Geodezy”, “I was on
          the point of choosing for this purpose the sites located between
          Dihistan adjacent to Djurdjan and the area of the Turks-Guzes.
          However, for me neither the vicissitudes of fate contributed herein,
          nor helped the efforts to get assistance with this”.
        </p>

        <p className="indent-6">
          Subsequently, he bitterly wrote about that and in the book “The Canon
          of Mas’ud”.
        </p>

        <p className="indent-6">
          Under these conditions, staying in Gurgan was threatening to
          al-Biruni’s life. That is why he decided to return to Khorezm.
        </p>

        <p className="indent-6">
          There is no exact information on when al-Biruni left Gurgan and when
          he returned to Khorezm. According to the piece of information
          contained in the “Canon of Mas’ud”, which many experts in al-Biruni
          studies disregarded, he returned to Khorezm, this time to his new
          capital-city of Gurganj, sometime in early 1004 he reports in the
          “Canon of Mas’ud” that he observed three lunar eclipses. The first two
          of these were in Gurgan in 393 AH on 14 Rabi 'al-Akhira and on 13
          Shawwal, i.e. February 20 and August 15, 1003, respectively. Regarding
          the third eclipse observation, he writes the following: “The third
          eclipse was on Wednesday night on the fourteenth [day] of the month of
          Ramadan, three hundred and ninety-four. It was observed in its middle
          in al-Djurdjania in Khorezm”.
        </p>

        <p className="indent-6">
          The mentioned here al-Djurdjania - Gurganj, became the capital of
          Khorezm in 995, and 14 Ramadan 394 AH corresponds to 5 July 1004 AD.
          From the above it follows that al-Biruni arrived in Gurganj at the end
          of 1003 or early in 1004 AD. According to the data available,
          al-Biruni was invited here by Khorezmshah Abu-l-Hasan Ali ibn
          al-Ma’mun, at the request of arrived here in 1002 Abu Ali Ibn Sina and
          his teacher, the famous physician and philosopher Abu Sahl al-Masihi.
          Apart from these two prominent scholars, in Gurganj al-Biruni met his
          teacher Abu Nasr ibn Iraq as well as the mathematician and physician
          Abu al-Khair al-Hammar. Thus, a scientific circle had been formed in
          Gurganj by mid-1004, which later received the name “al-Ma’mun
          Academy”. There is little information on what al-Biruni worked during
          the first period after returning to Khorezm. In the “Canon of Mas’ud”
          he only wrote that in 378 of Yazdigerd on 21 Tir-mah, i.e. on 2 June
          1010, he observed a star Simak al-A’zal (Simak Unarmed).
        </p>

        <p className="indent-6">
          Under the reign of the last of the Ma’munid rulers, i.e. of
          Khorezmshah Abu al-Abbas al-Ma’mun ibn al-Ma’mun between 1010 and
          1017, there were provided comprehensive facilities for scientific
          studies of al-Biruni. The scholar, in his “Geodezy” characterized his
          position after departure from Khorezm in 995 and after his third
          return to his motherland as follows, “After that, during several
          years, there was no safe rest for me until the time allowed order to
          be restored. I hated the vicissitudes of life, though some fools
          envied me in something and compassionate sage pitied me for these
          [vicissitudes of fate]. Then I found a little leisure for measurements
          during the days of [reign of] murdered Emir Abu-l-Abbas Khorezmshah,
          let Allah explain his arguments!”.
        </p>
        <p className="indent-6">
          In these years, the scientist is experimenting with precious stones
          and minerals, taking interest in determining their weight and for the
          first time in the history of physics and mineralogy specified
          accurately the specific gravity. He provided the results of his
          investigations in a special treatise “On the relationship between the
          volume of metals and precious stones”.
        </p>
        <p className="indent-6">
          The most intense astronomical observations of al-Biruni during this
          his stay in Khorezm, fall to 1016. This year alone he made a number of
          epochal observations. Five of them took place in June, one in July,
          two in August, four in September, one in November and one observation
          in December, respectively. However, the observation made in AH 407, 4
          Rajab / December 7, 1016 AD was the last one made in Khorezm. During
          these observations, al-Biruni solves the complex of problems in
          astronomy, geography and geodesy, among other things, he measured the
          longitude and latitude of the city, the height of the sun at the
          equinoxes and solstices, the angle of the ecliptic to the celestial
          equator and determined the local time of the city. The results of
          those observations were included by al-Biruni in his treatise “The
          Method for determining the position of the Sun”, written in the same
          year.
        </p>

        <p className="indent-6">
          However, the stage of history of the region being catastrophic to
          Khorezm and severe to al-Biruni’s life had begun from 1017. At the
          beginning of 1017or at the end of the previous year, the increased
          competition took place in the court of Khorezmshah, the court nobles
          stepped back from their ruler and al-Ma’mun, after a quarrel with
          them, made al-Biruni his only confidant and made him his political
          adviser. In his work “Famous people of Khorezm”, which is not extant
          in its entirety, al-Biruni reports that Khorezmshah al-Ma’mun ibn
          al-Ma’mun, despite the fact that he was a “learned, glorious, and
          vigorous and steadfast in the affairs”, a lot of time and resources
          spent on entertainment and cared little of economic affairs of the
          state and the political situation. These shortcomings have led Khorezm
          to disaster and the death of himself.{" "}
        </p>
        <p className="indent-6">
          In March of that 1017, the rebel citizens killed Khorezmshah
          Abu-l-Abbas al-Ma’mun ibn al-Ma’mun, then riots broke out in the city
          and in the country. However, the last of al-Ma’munid Khorezmshahs
          Abu-l-Abbas was married to the sister of the ruler of the powerful
          state in the south of the Ghaznavids - Mahmud of Gazna. Under the
          pretense of revenge for his son-in-law Mahmud gathered a large army
          and came to Gurganj. He hung up the leaders of the rebels and several
          provocateurs and stayed in Khorezm to the end of 1017, then returned
          to Ghazna making sure that the order in the country had been
          established. The sultan took Abu Nasr ibn Iraq, Abu al-Rayhan
          al-Biruni and many prisoners to his country. The number of prisoners
          taken away was so great that when the end of the chain was still on
          the Jayhun (Amu Darya River), its beginning was near Lahor and Multan.
          In such a way, the Ghazna period of al-Biruni’s life had begun.
        </p>
        <p className="indent-6">
          The first years in Gazna were difficult for al-Biruni. According to
          extant information about the life of al-Biruni in Ghazna, his life was
          in danger several times. Among those grouped around the Sultan Mahmud
          and related to science, along with real scholars there were also
          persons wearing the apparel of learning, but in fact they were
          ignorant liars and laymen, the true enemies of science and
          scholarship. They enjoyed the respect and attention of the Sultan
          Mahmud, who listened to their words. Fearing exposure and deprivation
          of privileges, they took up arms against al-Biruni, the newly arrived
          in Ghazna, and began to pursue him. In the preface to the “Geodezy”
          al-Biruni in ruthless expressions criticizes them in the context of
          history and the future generations.{" "}
        </p>
        <p className="indent-6">
          However, in the palace of the Sultan Mahmud there were court-officials
          like vizier Hodja Hasan who looked with favor on the scholar. They
          defended al-Biruni before the Sultan and removed the danger. Despite
          this difficult situation, the scientist with an unflinching
          determination pursued the research.{" "}

        <p className="indent-6">
          Immediately upon arrival in Ghazna, al-Biruni started writing the
          “Geodezy” and simultaneously was writing his historical work the
          “Famous people of Khorezm”. As it is mentioned in a fragment of the
          work, preserved by Abu-l-Fadl al-Bayhaqi, al-Biruni relates in it the
          history of Khorezm from ancient times up to 1017.{" "}
        </p>

        <p className="indent-6">
          In 1019 and 1020, al-Biruni makes in Ghazna a number of astronomical
          observations - in March and September 1019 he watches equinox and
          eclipse of the moon and the sun; in June, July, November and December
          he measures the solar elevations. In the same year with the
          astronomical observations he defines the geographic coordinates of
          Ghazna.
        </p>
        <p className="indent-6">
          The years between the observation on 5 December 1020 and the
          completing the “Geodezy” - September 20, 1025, al-Biruni spent in
          India. Actually, during those years al-Biruni carried out observations
          in the fortress Nandna in India (now in northeastern Pakistan).
          Through these measurements, he found the latitude of Nandna equal to
          320. For this latitude, he takes measurements of the Earth and the
          length of one degree of the Earth meridian he determines as equal to
          55р53I15II mile. It was a high degree of accuracy for the time. As the
          scholar mentioned, in his “Zij Brightness”, where he in 416 year 27
          Safar / 1025 29 April saw the new moon. In addition, this date
          al-Biruni writes as of the date of the meeting near Samarkand between
          Yusufhan Karakhanid and Mahmud Ghaznavid and signing the agreement on
          the borders between these two countries. By this agreement, Jayhun
          (Amu Darya River) was defined the boundary between the two countries.
        </p>
        <p className="indent-6">
          Of the works that al-Biruni wrote in Gazna after the “Geodezy” a
          distinctive place is taken by the mathematical treatise completed in
          August 1027 “Determination of chords in a circle by means of
          properties of an inscribed polygonal line” (shortened to: “Chords”).
          An important feature of this work is that in it al-Biruni provides the
          names of unknown to science or little-known scholars of Central Asia
          and Khorasan, and gives information about their mathematical work, as
          well as new information of individual scholars.
        </p>
        <p className="indent-6">
          In 1029, al- Biruni completed his major work, “Learning the rudiments
          of the science of the stars” (“Tafhim”). A Persian translation of the
          work is also available. Until now, there are extant his 14 Arab and 21
          Persian version.
        </p>
        <p className="indent-6">
          In this book, al-Biruni in question and answer format presents the
          initial concepts of mathematics, astronomy, geography, chronology, and
          astrology, only delving into the questions of the latter.
        </p>
        <p className="indent-6">
          During his stay in India, al-Biruni communicates with Indian scholars,
          improves his knowledge of Sanskrit - the scientific language in India,
          the first knowledge of which he received as a youth in his home
          country from the Indian merchants; he studies the Indian scientific
          works written in Sanskrit. The results of his scientific research on
          the Indian land, he relates in his major work the “India”, completed
          in 1030. This work shows that al-Biruni has mastered the customs and
          religion in India, and studied their scientific works. It should be
          noted that in his “India” al-Biruni says about 180 titles of Indian
          writings, the vast majority of which is devoted to astronomy. Having
          participated in 16 military campaigns of Sultan Mahmud to India,
          al-Biruni, profoundly studied the science and culture of India and
          made the analysis and critical comments to some of their shortcomings,
          but at the same time, he highly appreciates some items and supports
          them. His “India” is the striking evidence to that. For the first time
          in the history of science, while making translations of “Almagest” of
          Ptolemy, “Elements” of Euclid, and his own treatise on the astrolabe
          into Sanskrit, and the treatises “Karana tilaka” [14], “Arkand” and
          “Khandakhadyaka” into Arabic, al-Biruni familiarized the Indians with
          the achievements of Muslims in science, and the Muslims with the
          achievements of Indian science, respectively.
        </p>
        <p className="indent-6">
          After Sultan Mahmud died in 1030 a new period ofal- Biruni’s life
          started. Despite the fact that the successor to the throne was
          proclaimed the youngest son of Sultan Mahmud Muhammad, his eldest son
          Mas’ud led the struggle for the throne and having overthrown Muhammad
          occupied the throne for a few months, he himself acceded to the
          sultanic throne (1030-1041). Then a sharp turn in the life of
          al-Biruni had begun. Sultan Mas’ud made him his confidant and rendered
          his protection to him. According to Yaqut Hamawi, the to-be Sultan
          Mas’ud and al-Biruni had long been in good relations. The fact was
          that in Mas’ud’s early years al-Biruni taught him Arabic, astronomy,
          and other physical sciences. In consideration of that, grateful Mas’ud
          was prodigal of favors and blessings to him. Al-Biruni wrote in the
          preface to the “Canon of Mas’ud” that Mas’ud has created all the
          conditions for his research activity and financially supported him.
          This is precisely why the scholar devoted his largest astronomical
          treatise completed in 1037 to the Sultan and named it in his honor
          “Al-Qanun al-Mas’udi” (also known as “The Mas’udi Canon” or the “Canon
          of Mas’ud”).
        </p>
        <p className="indent-6">
          The “Canon of Mas’ud” is considered by right an encyclopedia of
          astronomy of the medieval Muslim East. In this work, al-Biruni we
          critically presents the results of astronomical achievements of the
          East and the West, including his own ones, since the rule of the king
          of Babylon Nabonassar ( Buhtunassar, 747-735 BC) to 1030 AD. In the
          third book devoted to mathematics of the treatise, consisting of
          eleven chapters, the author for the first time uses a unit circle and
          extends the concept of a number, proves the theorem of the sines for
          plane and spherical triangles. Although al-Biruni adheres to a
          geocentric system of the universe, astronomy, he set forward a number
          of views and ideas. In particular, he proved the mobility of the solar
          apogee and discusses the implications of this. He shows great accuracy
          for the time when calculates the arc sine of one degree and produces
          one of the most advanced star catalogs (1029 stars).
        </p>
        <p className="indent-6">
          The “Canon of Mas’ud” left the deepest imprint on the history of
          astronomy. Canons and rules set out in it and a star catalog played a
          fundamental role in later writing astronomical treatises by Nasir
          al-Din al-Tusi (1201-1278) and Mirza Ulugbek (1394-1449) as the “Canon
          of Mas’ud” serves as a basic guide in observatories of Nasir al-Din
          al-Tusi and Mirza Ulughbek.
        </p>
        <p className="indent-6">
          In the end of 427, i,e. in September 1036, al-Biruni wrote his
          treatise, which represents a list of scientific works of the famous
          tenth-century philosopher, chemist and medical physician Abu Bakr
          Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi. In this treatise, he provided a list of
          his own works completed or pending before the date indicated. A brief
          preface to the treatise written by al-Biruni himself reads that in the
          early 1030s, he came to stay in his native land - in Khorezm. By that
          time, al-Biruni’s health had deteriorated, mainly his eyesight, what
          was the reason why he gradually stopped doing his favorite engagement-
          astronomical observations. Obviously, because of this, when Sultan
          Mas’ud was captured by the Seljuk Turks and died in 1040, al-Biruni
          did not leave Ghazna, but stayed in the capital with Shahab ad-Dawla
          Mawdud - Mas’ud’s son, under whose rule he seemingly had no previous
          privileges.
        </p>
        <p className="indent-6">
          In the remaining years of his life (1041-1048), an elderly scientist
          only dealt with mineralogy and pharmacognosy. Of the works written by
          al-Biruni in this period the two major treatises deserve attention:
          the first, “The information collected for knowledge of jewels” (short:
          “Mineralogy”), for which a scientist was collecting information almost
          all his life. Al-Biruni as a youth, when he was in Khorezm, and later
          in his periods of stay in Ray, Gurgan, India and Ghazna collected
          information about gemstones, their characteristics and properties,
          places of production and the stories, legends and popular beliefs
          about them and about similar minerals, studied their physical and
          chemical properties. He outlines the results of almost 70 years of
          research in his “Mineralogy”. In his treatise al-Biruni provides the
          information of the weight of things, their volume, for the first time
          in the history of science, he determines the density and specific
          gravity of substance with the modern level of accurateness, devises
          and builds special instruments for measuring specific gravity of solid
          objects, liquids, and provides their descriptions.
        </p>
        <p className="indent-6">
          The last work of the great scholar is the “Pharmacognosy in medicine”
          (short: “Pharmacognosy”). U. I. Karimov, the investigator of this
          work, considers that the author did not have time to complete it -
          some places in the treatise show the signs of incompleteness. By that
          time, the health scientist so deteriorated that while writing the
          “Pharmacognosy” the need to have an assistant arose. This task was
          accomplished by Gazna physician Abu Hamid al-Nahshai. However, the
          death of al-Biruni got in the way of full completion of the work and
          re-writing its fair copy.
        </p>
        <p className="indent-6">
          In 1974, a prominent Uzbek scholar-orientalist U. I. Karimov published
          a complete, scholarly annotated Russian translation of al-Biruni’s
          “Pharmacognosy”. U. I. Karimov simultaneously resolved the question of
          the date of al-Biruni’s death. He proved that the great Khorezmian
          died on 2 Rajab 440 AH / 11 December 1048 AD.
        </p>
        <p className="indent-6">
          To the last minutes of his life the scientist remained faithful to his
          love of science. Even on his deathbed, he aspired to knowledge
          teaching. During his long life, al-Biruni wrote many works in the
          fields of mathematics, astronomy, astronomical instruments, geography,
          philosophy, mineralogy, pharmacology, history, ethnography,
          chronology, and philology. A total number of works related to the name
          al-Biruni makes up more than 170. Of these, 143 works were written in
          scientist’s handwriting, the other 27 are devoted to him by Abu Nasr
          ibn Iraq, Abu Sahl Masihi and Abu Ali Jili. However, in the “List” of
          his works, he writes, “for me they are as second children in my arms,
          like beads on my neck, I do not make the difference between my sons
          and them”.
